# firespread_sim
Hello there!
This is a Simple fire spread simulation program. 

A little background to the code:
This is is the kind of project you put up on the fridge; one of my very first projects!
So, it's a throw-back. I had fun coding this simulation, it was very interesting to learn about different
types of modules and how they can be implemented.

This is a simulation of how fire spreads. It's a rudimentary principle used in games, as well as to simulate real life scenarios.
Fire simulations are also used for to predict how fires spread. 

The program requires DrawingPanel.py module and a text file representing the simulation world.
The simulation world is a grid of squares representing a square meter of ground. 
We will asume that vegetation is present, represented by green; and fire as red.

The program animates how the fire spreads from burning areas to areas of vegetation.

A text file is attached representing the world we wish the program to execute in. 
It can be edited easily, where the integers 0, 1 and 2 represent firebreak(yellow), vegetation(green), fire(red).
